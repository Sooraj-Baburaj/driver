                                <p>People, planet and profit are the three driving forces that keep your supply chain
                                    stable and organized. Building synergy and affirming co-existence are necessary to
                                    improve logistics performance without putting sustainability at stake. Designing a
                                    corporate policy that blends with environmental standards and societal
                                    responsibilities are vital to control rising environmental issues and related health
                                    risks.</p>


                                <p>Statistics report confirms supply chains are responsible for 90% of the industry's
                                    environmental impact. The supply chain comprises a lot of business components,
                                    from manufacturing to last-mile delivery, that can induce pollution and unbalanced
                                    resource utilization if not addressed strategically. So, every business needs to
                                    develop a triple bottom line based supply chain to safeguard people, the planet and
                                    profit.</p>

                                <h2>What is a Triple Bottom Line?</h2>

                                <p>Every corporate set-up and supply chain businesses need to align with sustainability
                                    standards that define social, economical and environmental harmony as the
                                    success benchmark. The triple bottom line is a yardstick to measure supply chain
                                    sustainability. It analyses how a supply chain promotes sustainability along with
                                    driving profit.</p>

                                <p>The term 'Triple Bottom Line' was introduced by John Elkington with a vision to
                                    develop a long-term strategy that brings:</p>

                                <ul>

                                    <li>Transparency in supply chain performance</li>
                                    <li>Improve economic situation and opportunity</li>
                                    <li>Boost local level activities and sharpen the competitive edge</li>
                                    <li>Reduce environmental impact or degradation</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>To understand TBL sustainability, it is necessary to discover the components in its key
                                    metrics:</p>

                                <p>Social measures are variables that look into health, well-being and quality of life. It
                                    can include a supportive work environment, gender equality in workplaces, safety
                                    mandates, business ethics, human rights standards, and labour rights.</p>

                                <h3>- Environmental Measures</h3>

                                <p>Environment measures in TBL focus on shifting perceptions to green environment
                                    practices by inculcating certified suppliers and reducing resource utilization (Fossil
                                    fuel utilization, solid and hazardous waste management, electricity consumption,
                                    etc).</p>

                                <h3>- Economic Measures</h3>

                                <p>The flow of money is a factor that determines the efficiency of any business.
                                    Economic measures in a supply chain look into various factors like expenditure, ROI,
                                    investment in sustainable projects and total growth prospects.</p>

                                <h2>4 Technology-Driven Strategies to Meet TBL Standards</h2>

                                <p>Developing a strategy based on the triple bottom line is necessary to build a green
                                    logistics platform. The boom in technology has facilitated high-end opportunities to
                                    digitize the supply chain, reduce resource utilization, optimize freight movement, and
                                    improve efficiency in last-mile delivery. Let's explore some technology-driven
                                    strategies to customize the triple bottom line:</p>

                                <h3>1. Automation & Real-time Data Insights</h3>

                                <p>Making the right decisions at the right time is crucial to saving time, money and
                                    resource utilization. Real-time data insights and visibility across all channels are
                                    necessary to implement a practical decision. Demand forecasting plays a significant
                                    role in planning and preparing warehouses. Investing in AI-integrated automation
                                    technology and freight optimization tactics are necessary to build a sustainable
                                    supply chain project to enhance customer services and secure your future.</p>

                                <h3>2. Optimize Fulfilment Logistics to Control Freight Movement</h3>

                                <p>Sustainability goals are gaining momentum considering the rising global warming
                                    issues and the greenhouse effect. A report shared by the WHO claims, "Air pollution
                                    kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that 9
                                    out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels
                                    of pollutants, with low and middle-income countries suffering from the highest
                                    exposures".</p>

                                <p>An efficient Transportation Management Software (TMS) is necessary to address
                                    environmental issues caused due to unregulated freight systems. TMS helps to
                                    reduce freight expense, track real-time updates, enhance delivery and control fuel
                                    utilization.</p>

                                <h3>3. Utilize Blockchain Contracts to Manage Contracts</h3>

                                <p>Unlike a traditional database, decentralized blockchain technology stores data in
                                    blocks to ensure security and reduce data diddling. Robust and foolproof security is
                                    necessary to bring profit and mutual benefits through a trade pact. Blockchain
                                    technology helps stakeholders to sign contractual clauses through smart contract
                                    technology that eliminates human errors and disputes.</p>

                                <p>The auto-execution modality of the blockchain system improves efficiency in
                                    contract management by boosting visibility and facilitating a real-time tracking
                                    system.</p>


                                <h3>4. Integrate Emission Tracking System</h3>

                                <p>Inspecting all levels of the supply chain and calculating the carbon footprint is
                                    necessary to develop an emission tracking system that eliminates pollution issues
                                    and disruptions. If you want to create value for your customers, employees and
                                    stakeholders, it is necessary to mitigate pollution and other kinds of environmental
                                    and social issues caused due to an unoptimised supply chain.</p>

                                <p>AI-integrated emission tracking systems are highly useful as they provide emission
                                    data visualization tools and real-time tracking tools that help to instantly get
                                    updates about your performance.</p>
